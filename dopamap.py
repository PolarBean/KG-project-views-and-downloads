            "value": "This project  integrates a large body of immuno-labelled microscopy image data in a common reference atlas to provide an atlas of the developing mouse dopaminergic system. The images show distribution of dopamine 1- and 2â€“receptor positive neurons in the mouse brain, with age groups ranging from postnatal day 17 to 70. The age groups included correspond to key developmental milestones, defined as follows (+ / - 1 day for each age group): juvenile (17 days), preadolescent (25 days), adolescent (35 days), late adolescent (49 days) and adult (70 days)."
